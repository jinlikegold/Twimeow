## Twimeow

A Twitter-like app where one can tweet, reply, and interact as user @AnonymousCat! Originally a JS learning tutorial project, I made significant additions to the tutorial code.

App features I created:
* The ability to reply to existing tweets (the hardcoded tweetsData object containing the first 3 tweets and replies was created by Scrimba)
* The option to delete tweets and replies, as well as restore deleted tweets
* All new tweets, replies, and interactions are saved in local storage and resumes upon browser refresh
* Option to clear content stored in browser and start over

I learned a lot working on this project! I wrote and rewrote several of the features in my pursuit to create the best user experience, including opting to have the trash icon feature delete tweets and replies only from the data rather than permanently delete from the code.
